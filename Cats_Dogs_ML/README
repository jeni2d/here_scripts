With this model, you can identify whether a cat or a dog is present in the image.
result will be a float number from 0 to 1
from 0 to apprx. 0.3 - a cat is on the image
from 0.7 to 1 - a dog is on the image
from 0.3 to 0.7 - neither a cat nor a dog
I can't upload the model here because it's more 24mb, so here is the link to the model itself
